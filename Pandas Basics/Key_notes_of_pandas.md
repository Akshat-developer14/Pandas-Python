# Key Pandas Concepts

## Series
    -   A series is a one-dimensional labelled array that can hold any data type: integers, strings, floats, Python objects. Each element in the series has a unique label called an index.

    -   It is often used to teack changes or patterns over time, such as daily temperature changes, stock prices, or sales revenue.

## DataFrames
    -   A DataFrame is a two-dimensional labeled data structure that can hold multiple data types in pandas. It is similar to a spreadsheet, a database table, or a SQL table. Each column in a DataFrame is a Series.

    -   It consists of rows and columns, where:
        a. Rows have indices (labels).
        b. Columns have names (labels).
